            <h2> Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Ingredients: If using frozen fruits, you can skip adding ice cubes. If using fresh fruits, peel and chop the banana and wash the berries and greens.</li>
                <li>Blend: Place the banana, mixed berries, spinach or kale, Greek yogurt, milk, and any optional ingredients (honey or maple syrup, chia seeds, flax seeds) into a blender.</li>
                <li>Blend Until Smooth: Start blending on low speed and gradually increase to high until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little more milk to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Taste and Adjust: Taste the smoothie and adjust sweetness by adding more honey or maple syrup if desired. Blend again briefly to incorporate any additional ingredients.</li>
                <li>Serve: Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately. You can garnish with additional fresh berries, a sprinkle of chia seeds, or a small leaf of mint, if desired.</li>
                <li>Feel free to get creative with your smoothies by using different combinations of fruits, vegetables, and liquids to suit your taste preferences and nutritional goals. Enjoy your refreshing and nutritious fruit smoothie!</li>
