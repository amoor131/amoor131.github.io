            <h2> Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Prepare the Marinade: In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried thyme, salt, pepper, and optional honey or brown sugar. This will be your marinade.</li>
                <li>Marinate the Chicken: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, making sure it's evenly coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours if you have the time.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Baking Dish: Line a baking dish with parchment paper or lightly grease it with oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Bake the Chicken: Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it in the prepared baking dish. Discard any remaining marinade. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center. Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts.</li>
                <li>Rest and Serve: Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This helps retain its juices. Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired, and serve with your favorite side dishes.</li>
                <li>Side Dish Ideas: You can serve the baked chicken breast with roasted vegetables, steamed broccoli, mashed potatoes, quinoa, or a fresh salad.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your flavorful and tender baked lemon herb chicken breast!</li>
                <li>Remember to always use a meat thermometer to ensure that the chicken is fully cooked. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) for safe consumption.</li>
